This project will look into what are possible factors for the differing housing prices depending on location. We will use FourSquare data to see if the nearby venues or the amount of venues is the main factor for increased housing prices. We will also look into government provided demographic data on Helsinki area postal code areas, as well as how big of a factor public transportation plays. 

### The problem
1. Housing prices are drastically increasing in Helsinki and there seems to be no sentiment remaining on what is good and which is bad investment location
2. There are not many property investemnt tools for Helsinki area that are free to use, visual and easy to consume

### The main goal of this report is to: 
1. Find out which location factors play the biggest role in determining housing prices
2. Are there postal code areas that have the decired attributes of a good investment, but have belove average pricing thus being an outlier and a worthy investment subject
