### Description
This project will look into what are possible factors for the differing housing prices in Helsinki area depending on location. We will use FourSquare data to see if the nearby venues or the amount of venues is the main factor for increased housing prices. We will also look into government provided demographic data on Helsinki area postal code areas, as well as how big of a factor public transportation plays in the pricing. In the end suggestions for interesting housing opportunities are given.\ 
### Preface
The main reason for selecting this topic is that I wanted to create something that would help me and my friends to find better deals in the housing market. I hoped that with this project I could gather bigger data and bigger insights than is available through manually looking at houses and listings. So in essence I think this project was perfect started to get into data science, as I saw the both the good and the bad, desperately scoundreling the internet for solutions and better data and then feeling the greatest sence of accomplisment the next moment.\
\
I hope that this project will give valuable insights to people interested in buying a used home in Helsinki area or even give inspiration for new ideas for your own project. 

### The problem
1. Housing prices are drastically increasing in Helsinki and there seems to be no sentiment remaining on what is good and which is bad investment location
2. There are not many property investemnt tools for Helsinki area that are free to use, visual and easy to consume

### The main goal of this report is to: 
1. Find out which location factors play the biggest role in determining housing prices
2. Are there postal code areas that have the decired attributes of a good investment, but have belove average pricing thus being an outlier and a worthy investment subject
